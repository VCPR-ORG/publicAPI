  Ditto other active components e.g. Prescription??

Endpoint & Security Schema description as sentence (i.e. with stop, starts caps).
  Endpoint starts with "This endpoint ..."

Summary description as fragment (no caps/no stop)

Property description as fragment (no caps (unless [proper noun](proper-nouns))/ no stop)
  UNLESS LONG e.g., duration after last treatment during which some act is prohibited. Most often this restricts when meat or milk may be sold for food.
