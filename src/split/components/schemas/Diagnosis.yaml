  a medical diagnosis for which a Protocol may be used. Normally the `name`
  field is all that is shown in the UI, but the `id` is used internally to
  identify each Diagnosis, which should be treated as an immutable object.

  array of `id` numbers. Changes to other fields will have no effect at the
  persistent layer.
