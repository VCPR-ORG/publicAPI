  A class of animal for which a protocol may be used. Normally the `name` field
  is all that is shown in the UI, but the `id` is used internally to identify
  each Eligibility, which should be treated as an immutable object. Changes to
  the array of Eligibilities in a Protocol are done by changing the array of
  `id` numbers. Changes to other fields will have no effect at the persistent
  layer.
