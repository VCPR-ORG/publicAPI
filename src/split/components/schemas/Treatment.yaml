  describes a series of one or more doses of a single product in terms of a
  sizeFunction (which specifies dose quantity) and a SequenceFunction (which
  specifies when the doses should be given). These functions are polymorphic and
  may depend on additional data which only is available when a protocol is
  assigned to a specific Case. For example, the initiation time will likely be
  needed to calculate the dose sequence and animal weight or other data may be
  needed to calculate dose size.
